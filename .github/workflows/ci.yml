# TODO These dependencies blocks PHP 8.0 support for us:
#  - `liip/serializer` and `liip/metadata-parser` - shouldn't be a big deal. It's clearly possible to fix that.
#  - `phpmd/phpmd` - doesn't work for PHP 8.0 (it won't find any errors). Requires big changes in its dependencies, but work is already being done.
